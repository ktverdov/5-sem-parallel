main.c - implementation of parallel merge sort
main_1.c - sequential implementation of merge sort
analysis.ipynb - python script which generates random data, runs main.c and main_1.c several times for each number of threads and then builds needed plots (Note: it uses "initial_data.txt" for generated data and "data_merge.txt", "data_qsort.txt" for sorted)
